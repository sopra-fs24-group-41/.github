## Wombo Combo

Wombo Combo was inspired by the widely popular browser game [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/), we wanted to develop an online multiplayer word-merging game. Infinite Craft is a sandbox game using generative AI software where the player is given four starting elements: fire, wind, water, and earth, which can be combined to create new elements. We wanted to adapt and expand this idea by adding objectives, a scoring system, and multiplayer capabilities.
